# password
A simple password generator used to teach me about creating functions.
make_password() creates a password with a user defined length.
I used secrets rather than random as it is more secure.


## TODO
Use a list of English words to the mix to make it a little more memorable.
Add a way of choosing how many letters/how many digits.
